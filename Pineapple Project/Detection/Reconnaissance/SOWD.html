  <p>Detection</p>

  <p>Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.
    <br>
      Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.</p>
