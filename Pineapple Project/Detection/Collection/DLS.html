Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather data. Data may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.
For network devices, monitor executed commands in AAA logs, especially those run by unexpected or unauthorized users.
