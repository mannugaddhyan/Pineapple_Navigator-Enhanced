      </td>
      <td id="td1">Browser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist.[58][59]
          Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of client-side exploitation. The risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in implementation may still exist for these types of systems.

      </td>
      <td id="td1">Security applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior. [60] Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring. [61] Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility.</td>

      <td id="td1">For malicious code served up through ads, adblockers can help prevent that code from executing in the first place.
          Script blocking extensions can help prevent the execution of JavaScript that may commonly be used during the exploitation process.
