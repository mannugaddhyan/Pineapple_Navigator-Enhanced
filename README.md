## Downloading the Tool in a Remote Workstation
Just click on [Index](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/users/yogesh/index.html) to avoid downloading any files and directly go to Index.html.

Create a folder. Download the Index.html, Pineappligator.html and the Detection, Mitigation folders in the folder in the exact manner as put in the repository. This helps in getting the relative paths for the hyperlinks correct <br />



## How to Use
* Start with opening the Index file.
* Click on the link "Click to Open Pineappligator" in the center of the screen.
